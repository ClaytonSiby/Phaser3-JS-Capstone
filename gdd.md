- There are three levels to this game, two in which the speed rate of the falling bugs increases to make the level a little difficult & exciting.
- If player bumps into a bug, then it's game over & they have an option to retry the game.
- The background changes at each level to let the player know that they are now on a different level.
- At each level, we add one more type of bug & increase the speed at which they fall in.

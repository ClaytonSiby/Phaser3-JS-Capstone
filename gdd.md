# The Game Design Document:

- There are three levels of this game, you'll have to complete each one of them to earn more points & make it to the end game.
- The main goal of the game is to sharpen the way users retain information by remembering some pieces & matching them together in pairs.
- You can restart the game as many times as you want, but you only have a few chances to try matching the pieces on the board. Failure to do so, the game is over & you will have to restart.

# The Game Design Document:

- There are three levels to this game. On the initial page, users are required to enter their character name.
- Upon creating a game character, the menu scene pops up with options to display [ leaderBoard, Options(play sound or turn it off), game instructions.]
- The first level requires a player to dodge the falling bugs ( green bugs ) until their score is 20 000 & then proceed to level 2.
- On level two, we add another type of a bug & increase the pase at which the bugs are falling, players need to score 30 000, & proceed to the last stage of the game.
- The third level is the hardest of them all. We now have three types of bugs & the bugs are falling at an extreme pase randomly over the board.
- In the last level, the player is given three lives & if they use all their lives before reaching 100 000, they are taken back to level 1 & start over.
